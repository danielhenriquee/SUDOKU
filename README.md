# SUDOKU
Project for Algorithms and Programming I - 2023/1

This is a terminal-based Sudoku game developed in C++ as a programming assignment during the first semester of Computer Engineering program. 

It was created to apply fundamental concepts of programming such as:
- Multidimensional arrays
- Control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Functions and logic
- Basic I/O in C++
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Matrix manipulation
- Console formatting and visual output
  
Development Environment:
- Language: C++
- Compiler: g++
- Platform: replit.com – chosen for its collaborative coding features, real-time editing, and ease of access from both university and personal computers.
- Compatible with: Linux, macOS, Windows (UTF-8 support required)

Features:
- Randomized Sudoku grid from a base template
- 4 types of matrix transformations to vary puzzles
- Interactive input with validation
- Formatted Sudoku grid using box-drawing characters
- Move counter
- Simple text-based UI
- Cross-platform compatibility

NOTE: To properly display the game's interface, your terminal must support UTF-8 encoding. 
If you're on Windows, consider using a UTF-8–capable terminal or enabling UTF-8 with 'chcp 65001'.
